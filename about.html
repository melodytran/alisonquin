			<p>Most comfortable on stage, Alison enjoys performing all genres of music with a variety of ensembles. Whether she’s playing the piano and harmonizing to her favorite torch and rock songs, belting it out ‘a la Sally Boles’, or serenading audiences with Schubert, this versatile bohemian soprano is here to stay.</p>

			<p>A native to Northern California, she is thrilled to be living in New York City pursuing her artistic dreams. While living in San Francisco she earned her BM in Classical Voice Performance at San Francisco State University School of Music and Dance where she performed supporting and leading roles in a number of musicals and operas. She also enjoyed working with the infamous Gilbert and Sullivan troupe: The Lamplighters Theatre as well as the mischievous band of rebels that was The Miscreants Cabaret.</p>

			<h3>What People Are Saying</h3>
			<blockquote>"Ann the Virgin AKA Alison Sheehan,  kept insinuating I was a hotty.  Thanks,  I needed that. What a voice."</blockquote>
				<h4>-Miscreants Cabaret, Yelp Review</h4>
			<blockquote>"Played by the versatile Alison, it was indeed an eyeopener as she went from a naïve waif to a red-hot vivacious vixen that makes one wonder if she was indeed the same giggling girl at the start of the story."</blockquote>
